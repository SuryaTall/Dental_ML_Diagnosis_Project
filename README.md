# Dental_ML_Diagnosis_Project
Dental Diagnostic Tool
Deliverables: Analysis of Dental X-rays to Classify Oral Health Issues

Frontend
- Input for Diagnostic Images
- Display AI-generated potential diagnosis
- Visualization of Diagnosis [Heat maps, etc.]

Backend
- Takes the inputted images
- Image Preprocessing for ML Model
- Image Storage
- Works with ML model for prediction
- API to connect front-end and back-end
- Returns results to front-end display

ML Model for Diagnosis
- Deep Learning Model trained to detect dental conditions
- Accurate in Classification and Segmentation
- Explains line of reasoning behind diagnosis
- Continuous learning to improve model with more data

Cloud Storage
- Large-scale storage for diagnostic images
- Secure handling of patient sensitive information
- Scalable infrastructure for large amounts of image processing

Report Generation
- ML-based summary of diagnosis
- Visualization of Diagnosis [Heat maps, etc.]
- Exportable Reports
- Mostly displayed in Front-End as well
