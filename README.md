# Dental_ML_Diagnosis_Project
CNN for Caries Diagnosis and Classification using Pytorch
- Designed, trained, and tested  a Convolutional Neural Network for Dental Caries Multi-Class Classification.
  
- Used publicly available data to  train, cross-validate, and evaluate the CNN to differentiate healthy enamel from early-stage and advanced-stage caries.
  
- Applied Data Preprocessing and Augmentation, Adam Optimizers, Learning Rate Schedulers, and tweaked hyperparameters to enhance model performance.
  
- Achieved 85% accuracy on test dataset, demonstrating modelâ€™s optimal  generalization abilities on unseen data.
